    <p>This game was created as an end of year project in 2018 during my first year at AIE by a team composed of a designer, a producer, 2 programmers and 4 artists.</p><p>This was my first major project where I worked through each milestone with a team to create a finished product, emulating a real game studio.</p>

    <p>This project was created in 2019 during my second year at AIE. The idea was to produce a modular game system which can be implemented into any project. I decided to stretch my boundaries and create a neural network to be implemented into a snake game and trained via genetic algorithm.</p>
