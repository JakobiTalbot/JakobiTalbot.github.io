    <h3> Dino Throwdown </h3>
    <ul>
      <li> Working in a team</li>
	  <li> Project management and milestones</li>
	  <li> Controller input for several players</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Dino Throwdown was created in Unity as an end of year project in 2018 during my first year at AIE by a team composed of a designer, a producer, 2 programmers and 4 artists.</p>
	<p>This was my first major project where I worked through each milestone with a team to create a finished product, emulating a real game studio.</p>

    <h3> Neural Network Snake </h3>
    <ul>
      <li> Advanced mathematics</li>
	  <li> Knowledge of Advanced AI algorithms</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This project was created in 2019 using C++ during my final year at AIE. The idea was to produce a modular game system which can be implemented into any project. I decided to stretch my boundaries and create a neural network to be implemented into a snake game and trained via genetic algorithm.</p>

    <h3> KonGL </h3>
    <ul>
		<li> Shader programming (GLSL)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>KonGL is a basic 3D rendering program utilising C++ with OpenGL that I created in 2019. It was a demo to build experience writing different post-processing effects in shaders (GLSL).</p>
	<p>I managed to achieve things such as basic phong shading and texturing, as well as post-processing effects such as chromatic aberration, distortion, pixelation and depth of field.</p>
